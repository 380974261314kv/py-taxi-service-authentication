# Taxi service authentication 

- Read [the guideline](https://github.com/mate-academy/py-task-guideline/blob/main/README.md) before start

In this task, you will implement a visit counter, login/logout functionality, and make your site available only 
authenticated users.

1. Implement a visit counter on the home screen. It should show how many times a user visited the home page before.

2. Create login/logout screens. Provide authentication to your project using built-in Django authentication.

3. Display the username on the top of the sidebar and login/logout button depending on if the user is authenticated.

4. Protect all your views from unauthenticated users using `login_required` decorator and `LoginRequiredMixin`.
